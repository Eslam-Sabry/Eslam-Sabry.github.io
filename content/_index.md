        I am a Specially Appointed Assistant Professor in Condensed Matter Physics at Nagoya University. My research focuses on 1d topological superconductors, edge theory of fractional quantum hall states, and Majorana fermions.

        I am interested in exploring the properties of these exotic states of matter and their potential applications in quantum computing.
