I am a specially appointed assistant professor -which is just a fancy way to write postdoc- at Tanaka-Kawaguchi group, graduate school of engineering, Nagoya University. I have a variety of interests and very little time to explore them all. Currently, I am focusing on further understanding 1d topological superconductors and edge theory of fractional quantum hall states.
